There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of **non-empty** words from the dictionary, where **words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language**. Derive the order of letters in this language.

**Note:**

* You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
* You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
* If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
* There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.
